title: My Developer Goals
---

Working as full-stack developer for the past 3 years, I have learned that just knowing how to use the languages/frameworks to deliver a project does not necessarily make me better and more efficient in how I do it. Writing a blog for me is a way to organize how I go about learning new languages/frameworks, improving my current skillset. Additionally, it will help my soft skills how to demonstrate my knowledge in words and convey my own opinions.

## Current Skillset

**Languages** 
Python
Javascript

Want to Learn: Go

**Frameworks** 
Django
React

## Outline

Python
- Advanced knowledge of the language
- Dive deeper into Data Science/Machine Learning

Javascript
 - Important language features such as functional composition, prototypal inheritance, closures, event delegation, scope, higher-order functions.
 -  Asynchronous control flow, promises, and callbacks.
 - Learn how to properly structure your code and modularize parts of it, things like webpack, browserify, or build tools like gulp will definitely be helpful to know.
 - Learn testing frameworks.
 - Learn about some important new ES6 features (optional).

Data Structures and Algorithms

Django

SQL

React
